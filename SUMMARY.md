# Ollama Library Scraper - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a TypeScript web scraper for the Ollama library website that extracts model information, tags, and detailed metadata. The project is now ready for npm publication.

## Changes and Improvements Made

### 1. **Dependencies and Setup**

- ✅ Installed all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Updated all packages to their latest versions
- ✅ Added Vitest for testing framework with coverage support
- ✅ Added MSW (Mock Service Worker) for HTTP mocking in tests

### 2. **Project Structure Improvements**

- ✅ Moved `ollama-scraper.ts` from root to `src/` directory
- ✅ Created `src/index.ts` as the main entry point for library exports
- ✅ Fixed `tsconfig.json` to point to correct source directory
- ✅ Added proper file organization following TypeScript best practices

### 3. **Implementation Enhancements**

- ✅ Improved HTML parsing logic for better data extraction
- ✅ Added deduplication logic to prevent duplicate entries
- ✅ Enhanced regex patterns for extracting model parameters and metadata
- ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all public methods
- ✅ Improved error handling with descriptive error messages

### 4. **Testing**

- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite using Vitest
- ✅ Added unit tests for all public methods
- ✅ Mocked HTTP requests to avoid hitting the actual website
- ✅ Added tests for error scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Configured test coverage reporting
- ✅ All tests passing (12/12 tests)

### 5. **Documentation**

- ✅ Completely rewrote README.md with:
  - Clear installation instructions for npm
  - Comprehensive API reference
  - Code examples for basic and advanced usage
  - Detailed type definitions
  - Development and testing instructions
- ✅ Added proper author attribution
- ✅ Added repository and issue tracking links

### 6. **NPM Publishing Preparation**

- ✅ Updated package.json with:
  - Author information (helgesverre)
  - Repository URL
  - Bug reporting URL
  - Homepage URL
  - Files whitelist for npm package
  - prepublishOnly script for quality assurance
- ✅ Created .npmignore to exclude unnecessary files
- ✅ Added MIT LICENSE file
- ✅ Configured proper entry points (main and types)

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Model Listing** - Scrapes all models with search and sorting capabilities
2. **Model Details** - Extracts detailed information including readme content
3. **Model Tags** - Retrieves all available versions/tags for a model
4. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with exported types
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful error handling with meaningful messages

## Technical Findings

### Parsing Challenges

- The Ollama website's HTML structure required careful selector strategies
- Model descriptions were sometimes embedded within the model name text
- Needed to handle various date formats for "last updated" fields
- Tags page structure differed slightly from the main listing

### Performance Considerations

- Using Cheerio for parsing provides good performance
- No rate limiting implemented - users should be respectful of the server
- All operations are async for non-blocking execution

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OllamaScraper } from 'ollama-library-scraper';

const scraper = new OllamaScraper();

// Get all models
const models = await scraper.getModelListing();

// Search for specific models
const qwenModels = await scraper.getModelListing({
  query: 'qwen',
  sort: 'newest',
});

// Get detailed information
const details = await scraper.getModelDetails('qwen3-coder');
```

## Next Steps for Publishing

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Run tests to ensure everything works: `npm test`
3. Login to npm: `npm login`
4. Publish to npm: `npm publish`

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. Add rate limiting to be more respectful of the server
2. Add caching mechanism for development
3. Consider migrating from node-fetch v2 to native fetch (Node.js 18+)
4. Add retry logic for failed requests
5. Add pagination support if the website implements it
6. Consider adding a CLI tool for command-line usage

## Conclusion

The Ollama library scraper is now a fully functional, well-tested, and documented TypeScript package ready for npm publication. It provides a clean API for programmatically accessing Ollama model information without requiring manual web browsing.
